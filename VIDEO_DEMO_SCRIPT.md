# SECTION 1: THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)
## Duration: 30 seconds
## Goal: Capture attention immediately

### VISUAL:
- Start with a dramatic title card: "GAIA" with animated globe
- Then transition to you (face cam) or voice-over with relevant B-roll

### SCRIPT:

> **"Thirty trillion dollars."**
>
> *[Pause for effect - 2 seconds]*
>
> **"That's how much money is invested globally in sustainable funds. And here's the shocking truth: 85% of that data comes from companies literally grading their own homework."**
>
> *[Show quick flash of headlines: "Greenwashing scandals", "ESG fraud exposed"]*
>
> **"Volkswagen said they were green. BP said they cared about the environment. We believed them... until we didn't."**
>
> **"What if we had AI agents that could verify what companies actually do, not just what they say?"**
>
> **"This is GAIA."**

### VISUAL TRANSITION:
- Dramatic reveal of GAIA logo
- Quick montage of the dashboard interface

---

# SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:15)
## Duration: 45 seconds
## Goal: Establish the pain point clearly

### VISUAL:

### SCRIPT:

> **"The sustainable finance industry has a $30 trillion blind spot, and it's built on four fundamental failures:"**

> *[Show Problem 1 with icon]*
> **"First, SELF-REPORTED LIES. Companies submit their own ESG data. It's like asking students to grade their own exams."**
>
> *[Show Problem 2 with icon]*
> **"Second, YEAR-OLD SNAPSHOTS. Traditional ESG scores update once a year. But crises? They unfold in hours."**
>
> *[Show Problem 3 with icon]*
> **"Third, the GREENWASHING EPIDEMIC. Studies show over 60% of ESG funds unknowingly hold companies with significant sustainability violations."**
>
> *[Show Problem 4 with icon]*
> **"And fourth, the SDG DISCONNECT. No existing tool can tell you: 'For every million dollars you invest, how many lives will actually be improved?'"**
>
> *[Transition animation]*
> **"We built GAIA to fix this."**

>
> **"Let me show you this working in real-time."**

# PRODUCTION NOTES

## Recommended Recording Setup:

1. **Screen Recording**: Use OBS Studio (free) or Loom
2. **Face Cam**: Include small face cam overlay for intro/outro (adds personal touch)
3. **Audio**: Use external microphone if possible, record in quiet environment
4. **Resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum

## Editing Tips:

1. **Pacing**: Keep energy high but don't rush. Natural pauses build tension.
2. **B-Roll**: Add quick cuts to headlines/graphics during problem section
3. **Transitions**: Use smooth transitions between sections
4. **Music**: Subtle background music (royalty-free) during intro/outro
5. **Captions**: Consider adding subtitles for accessibility
6. **Zoom Effects**: Use Ken Burns effect or slight zoom on important UI elements

## Key Moments to Emphasize:

1. **"$30 trillion"** - Say this with impact
2. **"Adversarial debate"** - This is your innovation, spend time here
3. **Agent activation** - Show all 6 agents working simultaneously
4. **"The gap between what companies claim and what they do"** - Core value proposition
5. **SDG quantification** - Shows real-world impact

## Backup Plans:

- If backend is slow: Pre-record the demo section
- If agents fail: Have a recorded successful analysis ready
- Have backup company ticker (MSFT, GOOGL) if primary doesn't work well
